### Stay a while and listen! 👋

I'm Amit Netanel, a Unity game developer, Podcaster and teacher. Welcome to my humble github!

## 🌟 Featured Project: Unity MCP Sharp

**[Unity MCP Sharp](https://github.com/Abbabon/unity-mcp-sharp)** - The C# implementation of Model Context Protocol for Unity Editor. A production-ready MCP server that enables AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to directly interact with Unity Editor. Built with .NET 9.0 and the official MCP SDK, it provides 26 powerful tools for game development automation including scene manipulation, GameObject creation, asset management, and real-time play mode control.

🐳 Available on [Docker Hub](https://github.com/Abbabon/unity-mcp-sharp/pkgs/container/unity-mcp-server) | 📦 Install via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.mezookan.unity-mcp-sharp/)

- 🎮 I'm probably working on some mobile games right now. Some of my independant games are hosted on my [itch.io profile](https://abbabon.itch.io/), though most of my work went to bigger titles such as [Jelly Button's Merge Stories](https://www.instagram.com/merge_stories/?hl=en) and [Whalo's Fish of Fortune.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whalo.games.fishoffortune&hl=en&gl=US)

- 🎙️ [I have a podcast called Mezizei Hatransformim](https://linktr.ee/mezizim). If you think it's quite a mouthful in English, you are probably right. In Hebrew it means 'The Transforms Movers', which is basically what all game code usually does - move transforms around. It's a tech-focused Unity development podcast co-hosted with my friend (and awesome developer) [Yura Sokolov](https://github.com/migus88). We aim to improve Israeli development culture by getting deep into aspects of code design, career and project ownership, and self-improvement.

- ✍️ [I have a blog in which I (attempt) to lay down some tutorials](https://abbabon.github.io/) about utilities I've made. Add it to your RSS readers today! (does anyone other than me still use RSS as their main update tool?).

- 📫 How to reach me: If you want to chat, feel free to message me [on my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitnetanel/)

Let's make some games! 🚀

BTW here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Abbabon). I really like the format of just having one utility script that can help someone in distress. Real word to the wise however - don't just copy-past these. Understand what they do, and then incorporate them in a way that fits YOUR project.
