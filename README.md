### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

One day, there will be a boasting description of who I am and what I do here. But it is not this day!!!

BTW here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Abbabon). I really like the format of just having one utility script that can help someone in distress. Real word to the wise however - don't just copy-past these. Understand what they do, and then incorporate them in a way that fits YOUR project.
