### Hi there 👋

I'm Amit Netanel, a Unity game developer, Podcaster and nerd extraordinaire. Welcome to my humble github!

- 🎮 I'm probably working on some mobile games right now. Some of my independant games are hosted on my [itch.io profile](https://abbabon.itch.io/), though most of my work went to bigger titles such as [Jelly Button's Merge Stories](https://www.instagram.com/merge_stories/?hl=en) and [Whalo's Fish of Fortune.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whalo.games.fishoffortune&hl=en&gl=US)

- 🎙️ [I have a podcast called Mezizei Hatransformim](https://linktr.ee/mezizim). If you think it's quite a mouthful in English, you are probably right (in Hebrew it means 'The Transforms Movers', which is what all game usually do). It's a tech-focused Unity development podcast co-hosted with my friend (and awesome developer) [Yura Sokolov](https://github.com/migus88). We aim to improve Israeli development culture by getting deep into aspects of code design, ownership, and self-improvement.

- ✍️ [I have a blog in which I (attempt) to lay down some tutorials](https://abbabon.github.io/) about utilities I've made. Add it to your RSS readers today! (does anyone other than me still use RSS as their main update tool?).

- 📫 How to reach me: If you want to chat, feel free to message me [on my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitnetanel/)

Let's make some games! 🚀

BTW here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/Abbabon). I really like the format of just having one utility script that can help someone in distress. Real word to the wise however - don't just copy-past these. Understand what they do, and then incorporate them in a way that fits YOUR project.
